# Python-Text-to-Speech
This is a simple Python program that converts text to speech using the pyttsx3 library. The program takes a piece of text as input and then speaks the text aloud using the computer's default text-to-speech engine. The program also allows the user to change the voice, rate, and volume of the speech.
